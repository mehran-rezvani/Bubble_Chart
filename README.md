# Data Visualization with Plotly Express

This repository contains Python code for creating an interactive data visualization using Plotly Express. The visualization displays data from the Gapminder dataset for the year 2007, showcasing the relationship between life expectancy, GDP per capita, and population for various countries.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you understand the code and run the data visualization on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before running the code, you need to have the following Python libraries installed:

- [Plotly Express](https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/)
- [Plotly Graph Objects](https://plotly.com/python/graph-objects/)

- data_visualization.py: This Python script loads the Gapminder dataset, filters it for the year 2007, and creates an interactive bubble chart using Plotly Express. It customizes the chart layout and annotations before displaying it.
